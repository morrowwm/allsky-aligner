# allsky-aligner
tool to align constellation overlay

Very alpha.

Next steps:
* make the latitude and longitude configurable
* add a real file selector
* get the time from the image, for use in planetarium object
* get the constellation adjusting buttons working
* make the whole thing prettier
* get image and constellation scaling figured out
* present results in a form usable by allsky
* pull request on changes needed in all-sky for use in html/allsky/virtualsky/virtualsky.js
* * see https://github.com/AllskyTeam/allsky/discussions/3462#discussioncomment-8753359
  *  scaling, rotation, xoffset, yoffset
